#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 
total_bill= float(input("Enter total bill amount:"))
#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
bill_ph_with_tip= (total_bill/5)*1.12
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
rounded_bill_with_tip= round(bill_ph_with_tip, 2)
print(f"The bill with tip for each person is: {rounded_bill_with_tip}")
